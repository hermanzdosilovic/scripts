Scripts
=======

Scripts for specific tasks that I do not like to repeat by hand.

What can you find here?
-----------------------
* [java-course](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/scripts/tree/master/java-course) - Java Course tools setup
* [fast-evaluator](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/scripts/tree/master/fast-evaluator) - Evaluate tasks fast and improve your competitive programming workflow 

As I will work on my projects I will add other scripts that I make.
